## Across China: Robots patrol city pipes to detect defects
## 纵横中国：机器人巡视城市管道以检查缺陷

```HEFEI, Aug. 30 (Xinhua) -- A six-wheeled robot travels underground in Hefei, capital of east China's Anhui Province, to detect warning signs of defects inside the pipeline network.```
合肥8月30电（新华网）-- 在中国东部的安徽省省会合肥，一个6轮机器人在地下穿行以检测管道网内的缺陷告警迹象。

```"It looks like a toy car at first, but it's much more complicated than that," said Xu Mao, the robot's operator.```
”起初它看起来像个玩具车，但它可比那复杂多了。“机器人的操作员Xu Mao说。

```The pipeline robot, developed by Wuhan Easy-Sight Technology, is composed of four parts -- crawler, camera, cable reel, and controller.```
这个管道机器人由武汉易视科技开发，由四部分组成 -- 履带，相机，线缆卷和控制器。

```A full charge can enable the robot to work for four to five hours, covering a distance between 800 and 1,000 meters in the underground pipeline.```
机器人充满电可以工作4-5小时，在地下管道中可以覆盖800-1000米的距离。

```The robot made its debut last month in Shushan District. It will carry out inspections of the underground pipeline network stretching 150 kilometers.```
这个机器人上个月在蜀山区首次亮相。它会对绵延150公里的地下管道执行检查。

```"Whether the pipe is leaking, damaged or blocked. we can clearly see its interior situation through high-definition cameras embedded in the robot," said Qi Chuanshuai from the provincial construction engineering and testing institute, a partner of the pipeline robot project.```
“无论管道是泄漏，损毁，或是堵塞，我们都能从嵌入在机器人中的高清相机清楚地看到管道的内部情况”，来自省建设工程和检测研究院的Qi Chuanshuai说。该机构是管道机器人项目的合作伙伴之一。

```The real-time data including video images of the pipe will be uploaded and displayed on a computer.```
管道的实时数据（包括视频图像）会上传并显示在一台电脑上。

```"If we find any problems, we stop the robot and record the flaws," Xu said. "We report the defects to local government, who will arrange the repair and maintenance as soon as possible."```
“如果我们发现了任何问题，会停下机器人并记录下这个问题”，Xu说，“我们把问题报告给当地政府，他们会尽快安排维修。”

```With the rapid development of cities, it is becoming increasingly difficult to manage underground pipelines. Among all the difficulties, detecting flaws in the sewage and rainwater pipelines come first.```
随着城市快速发展，管理地下管道变得越来越难。在所有困难中，检查污水和雨水管道的缺陷是最难的。

```Many other cities such as Wuhan, Nanjing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai are using the robots to patrol their pipelines, the robot's developer said.```
许多其它城市如武汉，南京，深圳，上海，都是用机器人来巡视它们的管道。机器人的开发者如是说。

```Equipped with environmental detection sensors, the robots can monitor temperature and humidity, noxious gases, oxygen levels and smoke density, while providing illumination in real time.```
配备上环境检测传感器，机器人能监视温湿度，有毒气体，氧气水平和烟尘浓度，**并同时提供实时照明。**

```"Compared with human workers, robots are able to enter smaller pipes and are immune to poisonous gases in sewage pipes," said Ge Shengli from Shushan District's city management company.```
“与人类工人相比，机器人能进入更小的管道而且对污水管道中的有毒气体免疫。”来自蜀山区城市管理公司的Ge Shengli说。

```"No digging is required and there is no need to interrupt traffic," Ge added.```
“不需要挖掘也不需要中断交通。”Ge补充道。
